LJ048-0197|12501|I then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic and crowd control and that they should be alert for any persons who might attempt to throw anything
LJ048-0198|12502|and although it was not a violation of the law to carry a placard, that they were not to tolerate any actions such as the Stevenson incident
LJ048-0199|12503|and arrest any person who might attempt to throw anything or try to get at the President and his party;
LJ048-0200|12504|paying particular attention to the crowd for any unusual activity.
LJ048-0201|12505|I stressed the fact that this was our President and he should be shown every respect due his position and that it was our duty to see that this was done.
LJ048-0202|12506|End quote. Captain Lawrence was not instructed to have his men watch buildings along the motorcade route and did not mention the observation of buildings to them.
LJ048-0203|12507|The three officers confirm that their primary concern was crowd and traffic control,
LJ048-0204|12508|and that they had no opportunity to scan the windows of the Depository or any other building in the vicinity of Elm and Houston when the motorcade was passing.
LJ048-0205|12509|They had, however, occasionally observed the windows of buildings in the area before the motorcade arrived, in accordance with their own understanding of their function.
LJ048-0206|12510|As the motorcade approached Elm Street
LJ048-0207|12511|there were several Secret Service agents in it who shared the responsibility of scanning the windows of nearby buildings.
LJ048-0208|12512|Agent Sorrels, riding in the lead car, did observe the Texas School Book Depository Building as he passed by,
LJ048-0209|12513|at least for a sufficient number of seconds to gain a, quote, general impression, end quote, of the lack of any unusual activity.
LJ048-0210|12514|He was handicapped, however, by the fact that he was riding in a closed car whose roof at times obscured his view.
LJ048-0211|12515|Lawson, also in the lead car, did not scan any buildings since an important part of his job was to look backward at the President's car.
LJ048-0212|12516|Lawson stated that he, quote, was looking back a good deal of the time,
LJ048-0213|12517|watching his car, watching the sides, watching the crowds, giving advice or asking advice from the Chief
LJ048-0214|12518|and also looking ahead to the known hazards like overpasses, under-passes, railroads, et cetera, end quote.
LJ048-0215|12519|Agent Roy H. Kellerman, riding in the front seat of the Presidential car,
LJ048-0216|12520|stated that he scanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof.
LJ048-0217|12521|The agents in the follow-up car also were expected to scan adjacent buildings.
LJ048-0218|12522|However, the Commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the Presidential car,
LJ048-0219|12523|who must concentrate primarily on the possibility of threats from crowds along the route, provide a significant safeguard against dangers in nearby buildings.
LJ048-0220|12524|Conduct of Secret Service agents in Fort Worth on November twenty-two.
LJ048-0221|12525|In the early morning hours on November twenty-two, nineteen sixty-three,
LJ048-0222|12526|in Fort Worth, there occurred a breach of discipline by some members of the Secret Service who were officially traveling with the President.
LJ048-0223|12527|After the President had retired at his hotel,
LJ048-0224|12528|nine agents who were off duty went to the nearby Fort Worth Press Club at midnight or slightly thereafter, expecting to obtain food;
LJ048-0225|12529|they had little opportunity to eat during the day. No food was available at the Press Club.
LJ048-0226|12530|All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.
LJ048-0227|12531|According to their affidavits, the drinking in no case amounted to more than three glasses of beer or one and a half mixed drinks,
LJ048-0228|12532|and others who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly.
LJ048-0229|12533|The statements of the agents involved are supported by statements of members of the Fort Worth press who accompanied or observed them
LJ048-0230|12534|and by a Secret Service investigation.
LJ048-0231|12535|According to their statements, the agents remained at the Press Club for periods varying from thirty minutes to an hour and a half,
LJ048-0232|12536|and the last agent left the Press Club by two a.m.
LJ048-0233|12537|Two of the nine agents returned to their rooms. The seven others proceeded to an establishment called the Cellar Coffee House,
LJ048-0234|12538|described by some as a beatnik place and by its manager as, quote, a unique showplace with continuous light entertainment all night
LJ048-0235|12539|serving only coffee, fruit juices and no hard liquors or beer, end quote.
LJ048-0236|12540|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.
LJ048-0237|12541|Most of the agents were there from about one:thirty or one:forty-five a.m. to about two:forty-five or three a.m.;
LJ048-0238|12542|one agent was there from two until five a.m.
LJ048-0239|12543|The lobby of the hotel and the areas adjacent to the quarters of the President were guarded during the night
LJ048-0240|12544|by members of the midnight to eight a.m. shift of the White House detail.
LJ048-0241|12545|These agents were each relieved for a half hour break during the night.
LJ048-0242|12546|Three members of this shift separately took this opportunity to visit the Cellar Coffee House.
LJ048-0243|12547|Only one stayed as long as a half hour, and none had any beverage there.
LJ048-0244|12548|Chief Rowley testified that agents on duty in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief,
LJ048-0245|12549|but that their visits to the Cellar were, quote, neither consistent nor inconsistent, end quote, with their duty.
LJ048-0246|12550|Each of the agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee House (apart from the three members of the midnight shift)
LJ048-0247|12551|had duty assignments beginning no later than eight a.m. that morning.
LJ048-0248|12552|President Kennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in Fort Worth at eight:thirty a.m.
LJ048-0249|12553|and then at a breakfast, after which the entourage would proceed to Dallas.
LJ048-0250|12554|In Dallas, one of the nine agents was assigned to assist in security measures at Love Field, and four had protective assignments at the Trade Mart.
LJ048-0251|12555|The remaining four had key responsibilities as members of the complement of the follow-up car in the motorcade.
LJ048-0252|12556|Three of these agents occupied positions on the running boards of the car, and the fourth was seated in the car.
LJ048-0253|12557|The supervisor of each of the off-duty agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee House
LJ048-0254|12558|advised, in the course of the Secret Service investigation of these events, that each agent reported for duty on time,
LJ048-0255|12559|with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned duties. Chief Rowley testified that,
LJ048-0256|12560|as a result of the investigation he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner
LJ048-0257|12561|and that their conduct the night before did not impede their actions on duty
LJ048-0258|12562|or in the slightest way prevent them from taking any action that might have averted the tragedy.
LJ048-0259|12563|However, Chief Rowley did not condone the action of the off-duty agents, particularly since it violated a regulation of the Secret Service,
LJ048-0260|12564|which provides, quote, Liquor, use of
LJ048-0261|12565|a. Employees are strictly enjoined to refrain from the use of intoxicating liquor
LJ048-0262|12566|during the hours they are officially employed at their post of duty, or when they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon to perform an official duty.
LJ048-0263|12567|During entire periods of travel status,
LJ048-0264|12568|the special agent is officially employed and should not use liquor, until the completion of all of his official duties for the day,
LJ048-0265|12569|after which time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation. However, all members of the White House Detail
LJ048-0266|12570|and special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
LJ048-0267|12571|at any time while in travel status.
LJ048-0268|12572|Therefore, the use of intoxicating liquor of any kind, including beer and wine, by members of the White House Detail
LJ048-0269|12573|and special agents cooperating with them, or by special agents on similar assignments, while they are in a travel status, is prohibited. End quote.
LJ048-0270|12574|The regulations provide further that, quote, violation or slight disregard, end quote, of these provisions, quote,
LJ048-0271|12575|will be cause for removal from the Service, end quote.
LJ048-0272|12576|Chief Rowley testified
LJ048-0273|12577|that under ordinary circumstances he would have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clear violation of the regulation.
LJ048-0274|12578|However, he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise
LJ048-0275|12579|to an inference that the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events of November twenty-two.
LJ048-0276|12580|Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
LJ048-0277|12581|He felt that each agent recognized the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a repetition.
LJ048-0278|12582|The Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the White House detail of the Secret Service are arduous.
LJ048-0279|12583|They work long, hard hours, under very great strain, and must travel frequently.
LJ048-0280|12584|It might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.
LJ048-0281|12585|Yet their role of protecting the President is so important to the well-being of the country
LJ048-0282|12586|that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct,
LJ048-0283|12587|so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body.
LJ048-0284|12588|This is the salutary goal to which the Secret Service regulation is directed,
LJ048-0285|12589|when it absolutely forbids drinking by any agent accompanying the President on a trip.
LJ048-0286|12590|Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.
LJ048-0287|12591|It is conceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed alcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities,
LJ048-0288|12592|might have been more alert in the Dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in Fort Worth.
LJ048-0289|12593|However, there is no evidence that these men failed to take any action in Dallas within their power that would have averted the tragedy.
LJ049-0001|12594|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0002|12595|The Warren Commission Report. By The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0003|12596|Chapter eight. The Protection of the President. Part four.
LJ049-0004|12597|The motorcade in Dallas.
LJ049-0005|12598|Rigorous security precautions had been arranged at Love Field with the local law enforcement authorities by Agents Sorrels and Lawson.
LJ049-0006|12599|These precautions included reserving a ceremonial area for the Presidential party,
LJ049-0007|12600|stationing police on the rooftops of all buildings overlooking the reception area,
LJ049-0008|12601|and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable crowd.
LJ049-0009|12602|When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area, they were closely guarded by Secret Service agents
LJ049-0010|12603|who responded to the unplanned event with dispatch.
LJ049-0011|12604|As described in chapter two, the President directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members of the public.
LJ049-0012|12605|At these stops, agents from the Presidential follow-up car stood between the President and the public,
LJ049-0013|12606|and on one occasion Agent Kellerman left the front seat of the President's car to take a similar position.
LJ049-0014|12607|The Commission regards such impromptu stops as presenting an unnecessary danger,
LJ049-0015|12608|but finds that the Secret Service agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures.
LJ049-0016|12609|The Presidential limousine.
LJ049-0017|12610|The limousine used by President Kennedy in Dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic "bubble" top
LJ049-0018|12611|which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.
LJ049-0019|12612|The last Presidential vehicle with any protection against small-arms fire left the White House in nineteen fifty-three.
LJ049-0020|12613|It was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof top of sufficiently light weight
LJ049-0021|12614|to permit its removal on those occasions when the President wished to ride in an open car.
LJ049-0022|12615|The Secret Service believed that it was very doubtful that any President would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though transparent.
LJ049-0023|12616|Since the assassination, the Secret Service, with the assistance of other Federal agencies and of private industry,
LJ049-0024|12617|has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the President.
LJ049-0025|12618|Access to passenger compartment of Presidential car.
LJ049-0026|12619|On occasion the Secret Service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the President.
LJ049-0027|12620|Presidents have made it clear, however, that they did not favor this or any other arrangement which interferes with the privacy of the President and his guests.
LJ049-0028|12621|The Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions.
LJ049-0029|12622|Without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of Presidents,
LJ049-0030|12623|the Commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at Dallas which deserve special comment.
LJ049-0031|12624|The Presidential vehicle in use in Dallas, described in chapter two,
LJ049-0032|12625|had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the Secret Service agent riding in the driver's compartment
LJ049-0033|12626|to move into the passenger section without hindrance or delay. Had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat
LJ049-0034|12627|could have reached the President in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the President.
LJ049-0035|12628|However, such access to the President was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
LJ049-0036|12629|and by the passengers in the jump seats.
LJ049-0037|12630|In contrast, the Vice Presidential vehicle, although not specially designed for that purpose,
LJ049-0038|12631|had no passenger in a jump seat between Agent Youngblood and Vice President Johnson to interfere with Agent Youngblood's ability
LJ049-0039|12632|to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired.
LJ049-0040|12633|The assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
LJ049-0041|12634|in the protection of the President if the Presidential car permitted immediate access to the President by a Secret Service agent at the first sign of danger.
LJ049-0042|12635|At that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow-up car were expected to perform such a function.
LJ049-0043|12636|However, these agents could not reach the President's car when it was traveling at an appreciable rate of speed.
LJ049-0044|12637|Even if the car is traveling more slowly, the delay involved in reaching the President may be crucial.
LJ049-0045|12638|It is clear that at the time of the shots in Dallas, Agent Clinton J. Hill leaped to the President's rescue as quickly as humanly possible.
LJ049-0046|12639|Even so, analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer Zapruder
LJ049-0047|12640|reveals that Hill first placed his hand on the Presidential car at frame three forty-three, thirty frames
LJ049-0048|12641|and therefore approximately one point six seconds after the President was shot in the head.
LJ049-0049|12642|About three point seven seconds after the President received this wound,
LJ049-0050|12643|Hill had both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist President and Mrs. Kennedy.
LJ049-0051|12644|Planning for motorcade contingencies.
LJ049-0052|12645|In response to inquiry by the Commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade
LJ049-0053|12646|of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which actually occurred, the Secret Service responded, quote,
LJ049-0054|12647|The Secret Service has consistently followed two general principles in emergencies involving the President.
LJ049-0055|12648|All agents are so instructed.
LJ049-0056|12649|The first duty of the agents in the motorcade is to attempt to cover the President as closely as possible and practicable
LJ049-0057|12650|and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between the President and any source of danger.
LJ049-0058|12651|Secondly, agents are instructed to remove the President as quickly as possible from known or impending danger.
LJ049-0059|12652|Agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger,
LJ049-0060|12653|but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the President maximum protection at all times.
LJ049-0061|12654|No responsibility rests upon those agents near the President for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker.
LJ049-0062|12655|Their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.
LJ049-0063|12656|Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
LJ049-0064|12657|because the variations possible preclude effective planning.
LJ049-0065|12658|A number of steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency.
LJ049-0066|12659|For instance, the lead car always is manned by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials;
LJ049-0067|12660|the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points.
LJ049-0068|12661|A doctor is in the motorcade.
LJ049-0069|12662|This basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound.
LJ049-0070|12663|Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.
LJ049-0071|12664|If the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective devices and techniques employed are sound,
LJ049-0072|12665|those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency. The Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade
LJ049-0073|12666|who were immediately responsible for the President's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired.
LJ049-0074|12667|Their actions demonstrate that the President and the Nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the Secret Service.
LJ049-0075|12668|Recommendations.
LJ049-0076|12669|The Commission's review of the provisions for Presidential protection at the time of President Kennedy's trip to Dallas demonstrates the need for substantial improvements.
LJ049-0077|12670|Since the assassination, the Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury
LJ049-0078|12671|have properly taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.
LJ049-0079|12672|Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated, some of them in response to the Commission's questions and informal suggestions.
LJ049-0080|12673|Assassination a Federal Crime
LJ049-0081|12674|There was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0082|12675|Had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction could have been asserted;
LJ049-0083|12676|it has long been a Federal crime to conspire to injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.
LJ049-0084|12677|Murder of the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,
LJ049-0085|12678|the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.
LJ049-0086|12679|It is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers,
LJ049-0087|12680|without making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm to the President is a Federal offense,
LJ049-0088|12681|as is advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by the assassination of any of its officers.
LJ049-0089|12682|The murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and marshals, and a number of other specifically designated
LJ049-0090|12683|Federal law enforcement officers is a Federal crime.
LJ049-0091|12684|Equally anomalous are statutory provisions which specifically authorize the Secret Service to protect the President,
LJ049-0092|12685|without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him. The same provisions authorize the Service to arrest without warrant
LJ049-0093|12686|persons committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving Federal checks or securities.
LJ049-0094|12687|The Commission agrees with the Secret Service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant
LJ049-0095|12688|for all offenses within its jurisdiction, as are FBI agents and Federal marshals.
LJ049-0096|12689|There have been a number of efforts to make assassination a Federal crime, particularly after the assassination of President McKinley
LJ049-0097|12690|and the attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.
LJ049-0098|12691|In nineteen oh two bills passed both Houses of Congress but failed of enactment when the Senate refused to accept the conference report.
LJ049-0099|12692|A number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of President Kennedy.
LJ049-0100|12693|The Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation which would:
LJ049-0101|12694|Punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy to murder, kidnaping of and assault upon
LJ049-0102|12695|the President, Vice President, or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President, the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect,
LJ049-0103|12696|whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance.
LJ049-0104|12697|Such a statute would cover the President and Vice President or, in the absence of a Vice President, the person next in order of succession.
LJ049-0105|12698|During the period between election and inauguration, the President-elect and Vice-President-elect would also be covered.
LJ049-0106|12699|Restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
LJ049-0107|12700|or who hold important governmental posts.
LJ049-0108|12701|In addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of Federal power,
LJ049-0109|12702|that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties.
LJ049-0110|12703|The governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the United States ample power to act for its own protection.
LJ049-0111|12704|The activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
LJ049-0112|12705|bear no relationship to the injury to the United States which follows from the act.
LJ049-0113|12706|This point was ably made in the nineteen oh two debate by Senator George F. Hoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill, quote,
LJ049-0114|12707|what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption of the Government of the United States and the destruction of its security by striking down the life
LJ049-0115|12708|of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power, or
LJ049-0116|12709|of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case of a vacancy. It is important to this country
LJ049-0117|12710|that the interruption shall not take place for an hour, end quote.
LJ049-0118|12711|Enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt
LJ049-0119|12712|would be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.
LJ049-0120|12713|At present, Federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities.
LJ049-0121|12714|While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the early identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient and prompt,
LJ049-0122|12715|FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who strongly supports such legislation, testified that the absence of clear Federal jurisdiction
LJ049-0123|12716|over the assassination of President Kennedy led to embarrassment and confusion in the subsequent investigation by Federal and local authorities.
LJ049-0124|12717|In addition, the proposed legislation will insure
LJ049-0125|12718|that any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject to Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.
LJ049-0126|12719|Committee of Cabinet Officers. As our Government has become more complex,
LJ049-0127|12720|agencies other than the Secret Service have become involved in phases of the overall problem of protecting our national leaders.
LJ049-0128|12721|The FBI is the major domestic investigating agency of the United States,
LJ049-0129|12722|while the CIA has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the Department of State.
LJ049-0130|12723|The Secret Service must rely in large part
LJ049-0132|12724|The Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
LJ049-0133|12725|and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of broad national concern.
LJ049-0134|12726|The Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council
LJ049-0135|12727|(which is responsible for advising the President respecting the coordination
LJ049-0136|12728|of departmental policies relating to the national security) the responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities of the Secret Service
LJ049-0137|12729|and the other Federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. The Committee should include the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General,
LJ049-0138|12730|and, if the Council is used, arrangements should be made for the attendance of the Secretary of the Treasury
LJ049-0139|12731|and the Attorney General at any meetings which are concerned with Presidential protection.
LJ049-0140|12732|The Council already includes, in addition to the President and Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense and has a competent staff.
LJ049-0141|12733|The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the President,
LJ049-0142|12734|by defining responsibilities clearly and overseeing their execution.
LJ049-0143|12735|Major needs of personnel or other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have been in the past.
LJ049-0144|12736|The Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.
LJ049-0145|12737|As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.
LJ049-0146|12738|The expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.
LJ049-0147|12739|This arrangement would provide a continuing high-level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures.
LJ049-0148|12740|For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned largely as an informal part of the White House staff, with the result
LJ049-0149|12741|that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround Presidential activities.
LJ049-0150|12742|A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the President.
LJ049-0151|12743|Responsibilities for Presidential Protection
LJ049-0152|12744|The assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to an agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical accident.
LJ049-0153|12745|The Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department of the Treasury in eighteen sixty-five, to deal with counterfeiting.
LJ049-0154|12746|In eighteen ninety-four,
LJ049-0155|12747|while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland, the Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White House.
LJ049-0156|12748|Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to their vacation home in Massachusetts
LJ049-0157|12749|and special details protected him in Washington, on trips, and at special functions.
LJ049-0158|12750|These informal and part-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of President McKinley;
LJ049-0159|12751|the Secret Service, then the only Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.
LJ049-0160|12752|Since that time, the Secret Service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the President
LJ049-0161|12753|and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the President.
LJ049-0162|12754|Although the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the President,
LJ049-0163|12755|the FBI, which was established within the Department of Justice in nineteen oh eight, has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play.
LJ049-0164|12756|In the appropriations of the FBI there has recurred annually an item for the, quote, protection of the person of the President of the United States, end quote,
LJ049-0165|12757|which first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice in nineteen ten under the heading, quote, Miscellaneous Objects, end quote.
LJ049-0166|12758|Although the FBI is not charged with the physical protection of the President, it does have an assignment, as do other Government agencies,
LJ049-0167|12759|in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the President's security.
LJ049-0168|12760|As discussed above, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its Handbook
LJ049-0169|12761|the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received, quote,
LJ049-0170|12762|indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President, end quote, or other protected persons.
LJ049-0171|12763|With two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation,
LJ049-0172|12764|questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility.
LJ049-0173|12765|As the testimony of J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not believe that its directive required the Bureau
LJ049-0174|12766|to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
LJ049-0175|12767|before the President reached Dallas.
LJ049-0176|12768|On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,
LJ049-0177|12769|and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the FBI
LJ049-0178|12770|should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.
LJ049-0179|12771|The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.
LJ049-0180|12772|The Commission has the impression
LJ049-0181|12773|that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.
LJ049-0182|12774|In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
LJ049-0183|12775|regarding such threats and that its Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped
LJ049-0184|12776|to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the President.
LJ049-0185|12777|During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,
LJ049-0186|12778|the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.
LJ049-0187|12779|These proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
LJ049-0188|12780|in one or another Government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system
LJ049-0189|12781|but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.
LJ049-0190|12782|It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,
LJ049-0191|12783|is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the United States.
LJ049-0192|12784|It was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.
LJ049-0193|12785|Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President
LJ049-0194|12786|should be transferred to the FBI,
LJ049-0195|12787|leaving with the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.
LJ049-0196|12788|On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.
LJ049-0197|12789|It is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the Presidential family
LJ049-0198|12790|in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it,
LJ049-0199|12791|and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility.
LJ049-0200|12792|It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President
LJ049-0201|12793|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
LJ049-0202|12794|incident to its responsibilities.
LJ049-0203|12795|So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.
LJ049-0204|12796|While in accordance with its mandate
LJ049-0205|12797|this Commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas
LJ049-0206|12798|and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear
LJ049-0207|12799|that it was not within the Commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the President's protection,
LJ049-0208|12800|except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the President's assassination can be drawn.

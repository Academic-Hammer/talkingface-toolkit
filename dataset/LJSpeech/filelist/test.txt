LJ049-0209|12801|The Commission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission in nineteen forty-nine,
LJ049-0210|12802|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.
LJ049-0211|12803|It would have been necessary for the Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy,
LJ049-0212|12804|to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.
LJ049-0213|12805|There are always dangers of divided responsibility,
LJ049-0214|12806|duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand
LJ049-0215|12807|the protection of the President is in a real sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the Department of State,
LJ049-0216|12808|the FBI, the CIA, and the military intelligence agencies as well as the Secret Service.
LJ049-0217|12809|Moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established
LJ049-0218|12810|between the Secret Service and the President and his family is contemplated.
LJ049-0219|12811|These considerations have induced the Commission to believe
LJ049-0220|12812|that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,
LJ049-0221|12813|perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.
LJ049-0222|12814|Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination
LJ049-0223|12815|and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a position to and do, furnish information
LJ049-0224|12816|and services related to the security of the President.
LJ049-0225|12817|The Commission feels the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President travels abroad,
LJ049-0226|12818|could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination.
LJ049-0227|12819|Without, therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long-range organization of the President's security,
LJ049-0228|12820|the Commission believes that the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy point to certain measures which,
LJ049-0229|12821|while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities,
LJ049-0230|12822|can and should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President.

LJ050-0004|12826|General Supervision of the Secret Service
LJ050-0005|12827|The intimacy of the Secret Service's relationship to the White House
LJ050-0006|12828|and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of the Department of the Treasury
LJ050-0007|12829|have made it difficult for the Treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision.
LJ050-0008|12830|The Commission believes that the recommended Cabinet-level committee will help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision
LJ050-0009|12831|disclosed by the Commission's investigation. Other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0010|12832|Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the Department of the Treasury should be improved.
LJ050-0011|12833|The Chief of the Service now reports to the Secretary of the Treasury
LJ050-0012|12834|through an Assistant Secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the Bureau of the Mint
LJ050-0013|12835|and the Department's Employment Policy Program, and who also represents the Secretary of the Treasury on various committees and groups.
LJ050-0014|12836|The incumbent has no technical qualifications in the area of Presidential protection.
LJ050-0015|12837|The Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Service.
LJ050-0016|12838|This special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields
LJ050-0017|12839|to be able to provide effective continuing supervision
LJ050-0018|12840|and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to Presidential protection.
LJ050-0019|12841|This report has already pointed out several respects
LJ050-0020|12842|in which the Commission believes that the Secret Service has operated with insufficient planning or control.
LJ050-0021|12843|Actions by the Service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration.
LJ050-0022|12844|A formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the Service.
LJ050-0023|12845|Work is going forward
LJ050-0024|12846|toward the preparation of formal understandings of the respective roles of the Secret Service and other agencies with which it collaborates
LJ050-0025|12847|or from which it derives assistance and support.
LJ050-0026|12848|The Commission urges that the Service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures.
LJ050-0027|12849|While manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations,
LJ050-0028|12850|no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility
LJ050-0029|12851|that is reflected in definite and comprehensive operating procedures.
LJ050-0030|12852|The Commission also recommends
LJ050-0031|12853|that the Secret Service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit, for all of its personnel.
LJ050-0032|12854|This involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty.
LJ050-0033|12855|The Commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
LJ050-0034|12856|and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of November twenty-one at Fort Worth.
LJ050-0035|12857|Nevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated,
LJ050-0036|12858|is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the Secret Service require it to meet.
LJ050-0037|12859|Preventive Intelligence
LJ050-0038|12860|In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the President,
LJ050-0039|12861|the Secret Service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the President
LJ050-0040|12862|and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
LJ050-0041|12863|This was the consequence of the Service's lack of an adequate investigative staff,
LJ050-0042|12864|its inability to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought.
LJ050-0043|12865|The Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities. The staff of the Protective Research Section (PRS)
LJ050-0044|12866|has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has been put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the President's Office of Science and Technology,
LJ050-0045|12867|and of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense,
LJ050-0046|12868|it has obtained the services of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corporation,
LJ050-0047|12869|International Business Machines Corporation, and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts.
LJ050-0048|12870|It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the CIA
LJ050-0049|12871|and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at Walter Reed Hospital.
LJ050-0050|12872|As a result of these studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August thirty-one,
LJ050-0051|12873|nineteen sixty-four, makes several significant recommendations in this field.
LJ050-0052|12874|Based on the Commission's investigation, the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:
LJ050-0053|12875|Broader and more selective criteria
LJ050-0054|12876|Since the assassination, both the Secret Service and the FBI have recognized
LJ050-0055|12877|that the PRS files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the President.
LJ050-0056|12878|On December twenty-six, nineteen sixty-three, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,
LJ050-0057|12879|specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the former standard,
LJ050-0058|12880|which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.
LJ050-0059|12881|he new instructions require FBI agents to report immediately information concerning, quote,
LJ050-0060|12882|Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior,
LJ050-0061|12883|(b) who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of Federal, state or local government or officials of a foreign government,
LJ050-0062|12884|(c) who express or have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments
LJ050-0063|12885|and who have been involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and (d)
LJ050-0064|12886|whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government, end quote.
LJ050-0065|12887|Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that this revision was initiated by the FBI itself.
LJ050-0066|12888|The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;
LJ050-0067|12889|more than five thousand names were referred to the Secret Service in the first four months of nineteen sixty-four.
LJ050-0068|12890|According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0069|12891|the Secret Service had received from the FBI some nine thousand reports on members of the Communist Party.
LJ050-0070|12892|The FBI now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included Oswald.
LJ050-0071|12893|Both Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission the great concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,
LJ050-0072|12894|that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,
LJ050-0073|12895|result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved.
LJ050-0074|12896|They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.
LJ050-0075|12897|The Commission shares this concern.
LJ050-0076|12898|The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
LJ050-0077|12899|and in taking preventive steps.
LJ050-0078|12900|In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
LJ050-0079|12901|guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.
LJ050-0080|12902|The suggestions of Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.
LJ050-0081|12903|The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
LJ050-0082|12904|the interest of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.
LJ050-0083|12905|Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President
LJ050-0084|12906|or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,
LJ050-0085|12907|other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.
LJ050-0086|12908|Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,
LJ050-0087|12909|propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
LJ050-0088|12910|to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.
LJ050-0089|12911|While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,
LJ050-0090|12912|they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.
LJ050-0091|12913|It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.
LJ050-0092|12914|Chief Rowley believed that they would,
LJ050-0093|12915|because of Oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter of January thirty, nineteen sixty-two. Quote,
LJ050-0094|12916|I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a bona fide U.S. citizen and ex-service man.
LJ050-0095|12917|The U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me.
LJ050-0096|12918|I ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family. End quote.
LJ050-0097|12919|Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to express or imply Oswald's, quote,
LJ050-0098|12920|determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy his grievance, end quote, within the meaning of the new criteria.
LJ050-0099|12921|It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.
LJ050-0100|12922|The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,
LJ050-0101|12923|Leon F. Czolgosz,
LJ050-0102|12924|John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara -- four assassins or would-be assassins
LJ050-0103|12925|were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders. None had a serious record of prior violence.
LJ050-0104|12926|Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction
LJ050-0105|12927|that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It will require every available resource of our Government
LJ050-0106|12928|to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents.
LJ050-0107|12929|Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.
LJ050-0108|12930|The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
LJ050-0109|12931|Since the assassination, the Service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal
LJ050-0110|12932|and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service expects.
LJ050-0111|12933|Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection of information, it should enter into written agreements with each Federal agency
LJ050-0112|12934|and the leading State and local agencies that might be a source of such information.
LJ050-0113|12935|Such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be provided to the Secret Service,
LJ050-0114|12936|and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required.
LJ050-0115|12937|This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA,
LJ050-0116|12938|which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats,
LJ050-0117|12939|particularly those arising from organized groups, within their special jurisdiction.
LJ050-0118|12940|Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,
LJ050-0119|12941|they should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
LJ050-0120|12942|and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.
LJ050-0121|12943|Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.
LJ050-0122|12944|It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
LJ050-0123|12945|and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
LJ050-0124|12946|to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.
LJ050-0125|12947|Once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the Federal and leading State and local agencies,
LJ050-0126|12948|the Secret Service, through its field offices,
LJ050-0127|12949|should negotiate similar arrangements with such other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance.
LJ050-0128|12950|Much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,
LJ050-0129|12951|and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0130|12952|Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value
LJ050-0131|12953|unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder. In this regard
LJ050-0132|12954|the Commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its liaison arrangements.
LJ050-0133|12955|In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission
LJ050-0134|12956|that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.
LJ050-0135|12957|According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0136|12958|the Committee will include representatives of the President's Office of Science and Technology, Department of Defense, CIA,
LJ050-0137|12959|FBI, and the Secret Service.
LJ050-0138|12960|In addition, the Department of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective Research Section
LJ050-0139|12961|to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. On the basis of the Department's review during the past several months,
LJ050-0140|12962|Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.
LJ050-0141|12963|As a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service on August twenty-six, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0142|12964|directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,
LJ050-0143|12965|county, and State law enforcement agencies in their districts.
LJ050-0144|12966|Each of these efforts appears sound,
LJ050-0145|12967|and the Commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by Secret Service.
LJ050-0146|12968|Automatic data processing
LJ050-0147|12969|Unless the Secret Service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,
LJ050-0148|12970|the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted.
LJ050-0149|12971|PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
LJ050-0150|12972|Its present manual filing system is obsolete;
LJ050-0151|12973|it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other Government offices.
LJ050-0152|12974|The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.
LJ050-0153|12975|In the planning document currently under review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,
LJ050-0154|12976|to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote.
LJ050-0155|12977|Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
LJ050-0156|12978|this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment.
LJ050-0157|12979|On the basis of such a feasibility study,
LJ050-0158|12980|the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0159|12981|The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
LJ050-0160|12982|The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
LJ050-0161|12983|The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.
LJ050-0162|12984|In planning its data processing techniques,
LJ050-0163|12985|the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
LJ050-0164|12986|In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,
LJ050-0165|12987|the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0166|12988|The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,
LJ050-0167|12989|to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
LJ050-0168|12990|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
LJ050-0169|12991|and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
LJ050-0170|12992|This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,
LJ050-0171|12993|but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
LJ050-0172|12994|The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
LJ050-0173|12995|that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.
LJ050-0174|12996|Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.
LJ050-0175|12997|Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team
LJ050-0176|12998|to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
LJ050-0177|12999|This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
LJ050-0178|13000|to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
LJ050-0179|13001|Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
LJ050-0180|13002|so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
LJ050-0181|13003|The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
LJ050-0182|13004|Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
LJ050-0183|13005|Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
LJ050-0184|13006|has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
LJ050-0185|13007|The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
LJ050-0186|13008|in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
LJ050-0187|13009|Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
LJ050-0188|13010|each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
LJ050-0189|13011|that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
LJ050-0190|13012|However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
LJ050-0191|13013|More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
LJ050-0192|13014|can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
LJ050-0193|13015|Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
LJ050-0194|13016|and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
LJ050-0195|13017|Inspection of Buildings
LJ050-0196|13018|Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0197|13019|According to Secretary Dillon,
LJ050-0198|13020|the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
LJ050-0199|13021|The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
LJ050-0200|13022|The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
LJ050-0201|13023|in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
LJ050-0202|13024|Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
LJ050-0203|13025|in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
LJ050-0204|13026|Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
LJ050-0205|13027|Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
LJ050-0206|13028|suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
LJ050-0207|13029|Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
LJ050-0208|13030|salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
LJ050-0209|13031|The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
LJ050-0210|13032|the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.
LJ050-0211|13033|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
LJ050-0212|13034|While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
LJ050-0213|13035|field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
LJ050-0214|13036|Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
LJ050-0215|13037|these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
LJ050-0216|13038|In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0217|13039|the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
LJ050-0218|13040|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
LJ050-0219|13041|However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
LJ050-0220|13042|and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
LJ050-0221|13043|The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
LJ050-0222|13044|would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
LJ050-0223|13045|The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
LJ050-0224|13046|one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
LJ050-0225|13047|and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
LJ050-0226|13048|eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
LJ050-0227|13049|in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
LJ050-0228|13050|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
LJ050-0229|13051|as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
LJ050-0230|13052|Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
LJ050-0231|13053|Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
LJ050-0232|13054|to assist in its protection functions.
LJ050-0233|13055|Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
LJ050-0234|13056|It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
LJ050-0235|13057|It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
LJ050-0236|13058|Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
LJ050-0237|13059|the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
LJ050-0238|13060|which represents a departure from its prior practice.
LJ050-0239|13061|From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0240|13062|the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
LJ050-0241|13063|The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
LJ050-0242|13064|even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
LJ050-0243|13065|The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
LJ050-0244|13066|the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
LJ050-0245|13067|In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
LJ050-0246|13068|which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
LJ050-0247|13069|The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
LJ050-0248|13070|and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
LJ050-0249|13071|It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
LJ050-0250|13072|The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
LJ050-0251|13073|the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
LJ050-0252|13074|The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
LJ050-0253|13075|that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
LJ050-0254|13076|The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
LJ050-0255|13077|This no longer appears to be the case.
LJ050-0256|13078|Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
LJ050-0257|13079|Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
LJ050-0258|13080|Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
LJ050-0259|13081|some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
LJ050-0260|13082|the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
LJ050-0261|13083|from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
LJ050-0262|13084|Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
LJ050-0263|13085|it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
LJ050-0264|13086|The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
LJ050-0265|13087|with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
LJ050-0266|13088|The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJ050-0267|13089|between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
LJ050-0268|13090|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
LJ050-0269|13091|The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
LJ050-0270|13092|This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
LJ050-0271|13093|The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
LJ050-0272|13094|and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
LJ050-0273|13095|The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
LJ050-0274|13096|made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
LJ050-0275|13097|materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
LJ050-0276|13098|As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
LJ050-0277|13099|with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
LJ050-0278|13100|the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
